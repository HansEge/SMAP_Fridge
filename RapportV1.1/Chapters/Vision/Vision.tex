\section{Vision}

\subsection{App vision}
Fridge-i-nator is an app that works together with you and your fridge. It will make it easier for you to make a shopping
list and keep track of the items in your fridge especially if your share fridge with others. You can create an essential
item list, which is items you never want to run out of. That way if the item comes under a minimum quantity Fridge-i-nator
will automatically add that item to your shopping list. 
Fridge-i-nator will minimize the risk of you forgetting to buy items you need, and make sure you never have to check your
fridge before going to the supermarket.

\subsection{Personal visions}

\subsection{Mathias Friss}
While building the app, i wish to become better at designing system architecture, with well defined segregation of layers. I wish to create an app with clear seperation between UI and back-end.
Furthermore i wish to learn more about using fragments in android.

\subsubsection{Stinus Skovgaard}
I wish to become a firebase god!	

\subsubsection{Philip Schmidt}
In contrary to no former Android Development and Java experience , i'm striving to become a more experienced developer within the Android scene.
This includes a goal of being able to create a great UI experience to the users, managing API calls, maintenance and implementation of databases amongst a lot of other possibilities with the Android Studio tool.
\subsubsection{Daniel TÃ¸ttrup}
Through designing and implementing the fridge-i-nator in this app-project, I want to improve my app design skill. I also want to get familiar
with firebase, which we intend to use in this project, and even more familiar with
Android studio and the opportunities that comes with this tool. All in all, I want to be a better app developer.
