Daniels personal goals.
Through designing and implementing the fridge-i-nator in this app-project, I want to improve my app design skill. I also want to get familiar
with firebase, which we intend to use in this project, and even more familiar with
Android studio and the opportunities that comes with this tool. All in all, I want to be a better app developer.
